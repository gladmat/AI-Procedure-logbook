Yes, there is an official register. The most authoritative source for this data is the Ministry of Health (Manatū Hauora), which publishes downloadable CSV files of all certified providers.
The Official Source
You can download the exact datasets to populate your database here:
 * Ministry of Health - Certified Private Hospital Providers (CSV)
 * Ministry of Health - Certified Public Hospital Providers (CSV)
For your app, I have compiled a "Starter List" below of the major surgical facilities in New Zealand. This includes the main Te Whatu Ora (Public) hospitals and the major Private Surgical hospitals.
Implementation Strategy for Your App
Do not force the user to scroll through a dropdown of 150+ facilities every time they operate.
 * Database: Seed your Facilities table with this master list.
 * User Settings: In the "Profile" section we designed in ReconLog V8, allow the user to select their "Active Hospitals" (e.g., Waikato Hospital + Braemar Hospital).
 * Logbook Entry: The dropdown only shows the 2-3 hospitals they actually work at.

Action Plan for Replit
You should add this data as a Seed Script so your database is pre-populated.

> Use the following structure:
> { name: 'Waikato Hospital', region: 'Waikato', type: 'Public' },
> { name: 'Braemar Hospital', region: 'Waikato', type: 'Private' },
> ... [Insert the list above]
> Update the 'Settings' page to allow users to search this master list and add facilities to their personal 'My Hospitals' list."
